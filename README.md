For the assignment to be handed in 9/12/2020

* changed rollIt function to be 1 line instead of 3
* changed player 2 to be an ai with intelligent decision making
* added a game mode function to be able to play with a custom interval
* added a js file that allows for include of other html files, this is done with an XMLHttpRequest(). w3schools has a way of doing it, but it doesnt respond well to recursive calls.
* tutorial.html is now much easier to read and get an overview of than previous version.
* added an interval that shows which 2 numbers are chosen, in case no number is chosen and it is random.
